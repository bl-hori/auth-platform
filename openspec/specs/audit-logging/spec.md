## Overview
The Audit Logging capability provides tamper-proof recording and querying of all authorization decisions and administrative actions for compliance and security investigation.

- **AND** returns paginated results (default 50, max 1000 per page)
- **AND** includes total count for pagination

### Requirement: Audit Report Generation
The system SHALL generate compliance reports from audit logs.

#### Scenario: Generate access report
- **WHEN** an auditor requests an access report for a user
- **THEN** the system compiles all authorization events
- **AND** groups by resource and time period

#### Scenario: Generate compliance report
- **WHEN** generating SOC2/ISO27001 compliance report
- **THEN** the system extracts relevant audit events
- **AND** applies compliance-specific filters and formatting
- **AND** includes executive summary and detailed findings
- **AND** digitally signs the report for authenticity

#### Scenario: Schedule automated reports
- **WHEN** an administrator schedules recurring reports
- **THEN** the system generates reports on defined schedule
- **AND** delivers via configured channels (email, S3, etc.)
- **AND** includes only data from the reporting period

### Requirement: Real-Time Audit Streaming
The system SHALL support real-time streaming of audit events to SIEM systems.

#### Scenario: Stream to SIEM via Syslog
- **WHEN** audit events are generated
- **THEN** the system sends to configured Syslog endpoint
- **AND** uses CEF (Common Event Format) for compatibility
- **AND** handles connection failures with local buffering

#### Scenario: Stream via HTTP webhook
- **WHEN** audit events occur and webhook is configured
- **THEN** the system POSTs JSON payload to webhook URL
- **AND** retries failed deliveries with exponential backoff
- **AND** logs webhook delivery failures for investigation

#### Scenario: Kafka audit stream
- **WHEN** publishing to audit Kafka topic
