# Policy Management Specification

## Overview
The Policy Management capability provides comprehensive lifecycle management for authorization policies supporting RBAC, ABAC, and ReBAC models.

## Requirements

### Requirement: Policy Creation
The system SHALL allow administrators to create new authorization policies through both GUI and code-based interfaces.

#### Scenario: Create RBAC policy via GUI
- **WHEN** an administrator creates a new RBAC policy using the no-code editor
- **THEN** the system validates the policy syntax
- **AND** the policy is saved with status 'draft'
- **AND** a unique policy ID is generated
- **AND** the policy version is set to 1

#### Scenario: Create policy via Policy-as-Code
- **WHEN** a developer writes a policy in Rego or Cedar language
- **THEN** the system performs syntax validation
- **AND** the system checks for forbidden imports (e.g., password fields, secrets)
- **AND** the policy is compiled and stored
- **AND** the policy is associated with the organization

### Requirement: Policy Validation
The system SHALL validate all policies before activation to prevent security issues and runtime errors.

#### Scenario: Syntax validation success
- **WHEN** a policy is submitted with valid Rego/Cedar syntax
- **THEN** the system compiles the policy without errors
- **AND** returns validation success status
- **AND** allows the policy to be saved

#### Scenario: Detect forbidden imports
- **WHEN** a policy attempts to import sensitive data (e.g., user passwords)
- **THEN** the validation fails with error code FORBIDDEN_IMPORT
- **AND** the specific forbidden import is identified in the error message
- **AND** the policy is not saved

#### Scenario: Circular dependency detection
- **WHEN** a policy creates a circular role hierarchy
- **THEN** the system detects the circular dependency
- **AND** returns validation error with the dependency chain
- **AND** prevents the policy from being activated

### Requirement: Policy Versioning
The system SHALL maintain complete version history for all policies to enable rollback and audit.

#### Scenario: Update existing policy
- **WHEN** an administrator updates an active policy
- **THEN** the system creates a new version (incrementing version number)
- **AND** the previous version remains accessible
- **AND** the new version starts with status 'draft'
- **AND** the update is logged in audit trail

#### Scenario: Rollback to previous version
- **WHEN** an administrator rolls back to a previous policy version
- **THEN** the system activates the specified version
- **AND** deactivates the current version
- **AND** the rollback action is logged with reason
- **AND** all PDPs are notified of the change within 1 second

### Requirement: Policy Activation
The system SHALL support controlled activation of policies with real-time propagation to all Policy Decision Points.

#### Scenario: Activate draft policy
- **WHEN** an administrator activates a draft policy
- **THEN** the policy status changes to 'active'
- **AND** the policy is compiled and distributed to all PDPs
- **AND** all PDPs receive the update within 1 second
- **AND** the activation is recorded in audit log with timestamp and user

#### Scenario: Deactivate policy
- **WHEN** an administrator deactivates an active policy
- **THEN** the policy status changes to 'inactive'
- **AND** PDPs stop evaluating this policy immediately
- **AND** the policy remains in the system for audit purposes
- **AND** the deactivation is logged

### Requirement: Policy Testing
The system SHALL provide a testing environment to validate policy behavior before production deployment.

#### Scenario: Test policy with sample data
- **WHEN** a developer runs tests against a draft policy
- **THEN** the system evaluates the policy using provided test data
- **AND** returns the authorization decision (allow/deny)
- **AND** provides the decision reasoning
- **AND** no changes are made to production policies

#### Scenario: Batch policy testing
- **WHEN** a developer runs multiple test cases against a policy
- **THEN** the system executes all test cases
- **AND** returns a summary with pass/fail counts
- **AND** highlights any failing test cases with details
- **AND** execution completes within 5 seconds for 100 test cases

### Requirement: Policy Types Support
The system SHALL support three authorization models: RBAC, ABAC, and ReBAC.

#### Scenario: RBAC policy evaluation
- **WHEN** a policy is marked as type RBAC
- **THEN** the system evaluates based on user roles and permissions
- **AND** supports role hierarchy (role inheritance)
- **AND** allows resource-specific role assignments

#### Scenario: ABAC policy evaluation
- **WHEN** a policy is marked as type ABAC
- **THEN** the system evaluates based on user, resource, and environment attributes
- **AND** supports complex attribute conditions
- **AND** allows dynamic attribute resolution

#### Scenario: ReBAC policy evaluation
- **WHEN** a policy is marked as type ReBAC
- **THEN** the system evaluates based on relationship graphs
- **AND** supports transitive relationships (e.g., parent-of-parent)
- **AND** performs efficient graph traversal (<10ms p95)

### Requirement: Multi-Tenancy Isolation
The system SHALL ensure complete isolation of policies between organizations.

#### Scenario: Policy access isolation
- **WHEN** an administrator from organization A queries policies
- **THEN** only policies belonging to organization A are returned
- **AND** policies from other organizations are not visible
- **AND** cross-organization access is prevented at database level

#### Scenario: Policy namespace isolation
- **WHEN** two organizations create policies with the same name
- **THEN** both policies coexist without conflict
- **AND** each organization sees only their own policy
- **AND** policy IDs remain globally unique

### Requirement: GitOps Integration
The system SHALL support managing policies as code through Git repositories.

#### Scenario: Sync policies from Git
- **WHEN** a commit is pushed to the configured Git repository
- **THEN** the system detects the change via webhook
- **AND** pulls the updated policy files
- **AND** validates all policies before applying
- **AND** creates new policy versions for changed policies

#### Scenario: Git sync validation failure
- **WHEN** a Git commit contains invalid policy syntax
- **THEN** the sync process fails with detailed error
- **AND** no policies are updated
- **AND** the error is reported via configured notification channel
- **AND** the repository owner is notified

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Policy validation SHALL complete within 500ms for policies up to 10KB
- Policy activation SHALL propagate to all PDPs within 1 second
- Policy query API SHALL return results within 100ms (p95)

### Security
- All policy operations SHALL be authenticated and authorized
- Policy content SHALL NOT expose sensitive system internals
- Policy changes SHALL be audited with complete trail

### Scalability
- The system SHALL support at least 10,000 policies per organization
- The system SHALL handle 1,000 policy updates per day
- Policy storage SHALL scale to petabyte-level capacity
