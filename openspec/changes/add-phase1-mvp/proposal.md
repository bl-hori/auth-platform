# Proposal: Phase 1 MVP Implementation

## Why
The authorization platform currently exists only as comprehensive specification documents. To deliver value incrementally and validate core architectural decisions, we need to implement a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that provides essential authorization capabilities while maintaining high performance and reliability standards.

The MVP will enable early adopters to integrate basic authorization into their applications, providing real-world feedback to inform subsequent phases.

## What Changes
This change implements the foundational authorization platform with the following scope:

### Core Features
1. **RBAC-Only Authorization** (full ABAC/ReBAC deferred to Phase 2)
   - Role creation and management
   - Permission assignment to roles
   - User-role assignments (direct and resource-scoped)
   - Role hierarchy (inheritance)

2. **High-Performance Authorization API**
   - REST API for authorization decisions (<10ms p95 latency)
   - Multi-layer caching (in-memory + Redis)
   - Batch authorization support
   - Basic rate limiting

3. **Policy Management (Simplified)**
   - Policy-as-Code editor (Rego only, Cedar deferred)
   - Policy validation and syntax checking
   - Policy versioning (basic)
   - Manual policy activation (GitOps deferred)

4. **User Identity (Basic)**
   - User CRUD operations via REST API
   - Manual user creation (SCIM sync deferred to Phase 2)
   - Role assignment API
   - Organization isolation (multi-tenancy)

5. **Essential Audit Logging**
   - Authorization decision logging
   - Administrative action logging
   - Basic search by user, resource, time range
   - 90-day retention in PostgreSQL (TimescaleDB migration in Phase 2)

6. **Management Web UI (Basic)**
   - Organization setup
   - User management
   - Role and permission management
   - Policy editor (code-based)
   - Audit log viewer

### Infrastructure
- **Backend**: Spring Boot 3 monolith (single deployable)
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 15 (single instance with replication)
- **Cache**: Redis 7 (standalone)
- **Policy Engine**: OPA (Open Policy Agent)
- **Deployment**: Docker Compose for dev, Kubernetes for production

### Explicitly Deferred to Later Phases
- ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control)
- ReBAC (Relationship-Based Access Control)
- GitOps integration
- SCIM synchronization
- gRPC API
- Cedar policy engine support
- No-code policy editor
- TimescaleDB for audit logs
- Kafka event streaming
- Advanced analytics and dashboards
- Multi-region deployment
- Service mesh (Istio)

## Impact

### Affected Specs
- `specs/policy-management/spec.md` - Subset implementation (RBAC only)
- `specs/authorization-core/spec.md` - Core API and caching
- `specs/user-identity/spec.md` - Basic user management (no SCIM)
- `specs/audit-logging/spec.md` - Essential logging (PostgreSQL only)

### Affected Code
- **New**: All implementation code (currently no code exists)
- **New**: `backend/` - Spring Boot application
- **New**: `frontend/` - Next.js application
- **New**: `infrastructure/` - Docker Compose and K8s manifests
- **New**: `docs/` - API documentation, deployment guides

### Migration Path
This is the initial implementation, so no migration needed. However:
- Database schema is designed to support future ABAC/ReBAC additions
- API versioning (`/v1/`) allows future breaking changes
- Architecture supports future transition to microservices

### Risk Assessment
**Medium Risk**
- **Performance validation**: Must verify <10ms p95 latency target is achievable
- **Scalability**: Monolith may need optimization for high throughput
- **OPA learning curve**: Team needs to gain expertise in Rego policy language

**Mitigation**:
- Performance testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Early load testing with realistic workloads
- OPA training and documentation for team
- Architecture review checkpoints

### Success Criteria
1. Authorization API achieves <10ms p95 latency for cached requests
2. Successfully handles 10,000 requests/second in load tests
3. At least 3 pilot applications integrate successfully
4. 80%+ code coverage with comprehensive test suite
5. Zero critical security vulnerabilities in production deployment
6. Complete API documentation and integration guides

### Timeline Estimate
- **Weeks 1-2**: Backend foundation (Spring Boot setup, database schema, auth API)
- **Weeks 3-4**: Policy engine integration (OPA, policy management)
- **Weeks 5-6**: Frontend foundation (Next.js setup, user/role management UI)
- **Weeks 7-8**: Audit logging and monitoring
- **Weeks 9-10**: Integration testing, performance tuning, documentation
- **Week 11**: Security review and hardening
- **Week 12**: Production deployment and pilot onboarding

**Total**: ~12 weeks (3 months) for MVP delivery
